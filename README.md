# Soil-Monitoring-and-Analysis
This repository provides some key information and prediction about agriculture.
Libraries and Language used - Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM. 
I got a dataset of crops having minerals, conditions, temperature required, etc
I trained various models using it to predict the crop that can be grown in such condition and with what yield with max accuracy of kind of fertiliser required.
I used few supervised and boosting ML algorithms here.
